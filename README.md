# Spring Bean Explained: Lifecycle, Scopes, and Practical Examples

Spring Beans are the core building blocks of any Spring Framework or Spring Boot application. A Spring Bean is an object whose creation, dependencies, and lifecycle are managed by the Spring container.

For developers, understanding how beans are instantiated, initialized, and destroyed as well as how to configure their scope is essential for building modular, maintainable, and testable applications.

This repository provides practical examples showing how Spring Beans are created and managed and how their lifecycle and scope can be customized. With clear explanations and hands-on demonstrations, it helps you build clean, modular, and testable Spring Boot applications.

**Overview:**
* **Core Concepts:** What a Spring Bean is and its role in dependency injection.
* **Configuration:** Defining beans with annotations or XML.
* **Scopes:** Singleton, prototype, and other bean scopes.
* **Lifecycle:** Creation, initialization, and destruction of beans.
* **Annotations:** Using `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and other Spring stereotypes.
* **Practical Example:** A simple layered architecture example demonstrating Spring Beans in action.

I hope this will help you understand and apply Spring Beans effectively 🙂
